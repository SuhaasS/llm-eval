## Review — Task 2 (2026-08-05)

**Delivered:** `costs.py` — `ModelPricing`, `PRICE_BOOK` (4 models), `cost_usd()`, `UnknownModelError`. 9 tests, 18 passing suite-wide. TDD order held; failing run observed before implementation.

**Price correction — the one substantive deviation.** All four models were re-verified against the AWS Bedrock pricing page before implementing. Three matched the plan doc. **Kimi K2.5 output was wrong: $3.00/1M, not $2.50** — the plan doc took the optimistic end of `Model_Bakeoff_Plan.md`'s "$2.50–3.00" range. Implemented at $3.00; test expectation moved $3.10 → $3.60; the plan doc's Task 2 code block and Global Constraints line both corrected, with a dated note explaining why.

Understating a candidate's price biases the headline metric toward that candidate, which is exactly the failure this eval exists to avoid.

| Model | Plan doc | AWS Bedrock, US regions | |
|---|---|---|---|
| claude-sonnet-5 | 3.00 / 15.00 | 3.00 / 15.00 standard | match |
| gemma-4-31b | 0.14 / 0.40 | 0.14 / 0.40 | match |
| nemotron-3-super-120b | 0.15 / 0.65 | 0.15 / 0.65 | match |
| kimi-k2-5 | 0.60 / 2.50 | 0.60 / **3.00** | corrected |

**Confirmed, not changed:**
- Cache multipliers 0.10× read / 1.25× write — ratio holds across Sonnet 5 regions and price levels (us $3.00 → $0.30/$3.75; ap-southeast-2 $2.20 → $0.22/$2.75)
- AWS publishes **no cache pricing** for Gemma 4, Nemotron 3 Super, or Kimi K2.5 — independent support for the `None` multipliers and the raise-on-cache-tokens guard (spec §8)
- Sonnet 5 promo pricing ($2/$10) ends 2026-08-31; spec §8 settles the tier as standard, so $3/$15 stands

**Still open (Phase 0b, unchanged):** confirm actual per-candidate Bedrock cache *support* — absence of published cache pricing is suggestive, not proof. Re-baseline Sonnet 5 against the real AWS bill rather than list-price math.

**Follow-up noted:** `PRICE_BOOK` is US-region only; other regions run 15–20% higher. Flagged in a module docstring. If the eval ever runs outside us-east-1/us-east-2/us-west-2, the book needs a region axis.

`Model_Bakeoff_Plan.md` needed no edit — its Kimi row already reads "$2.50–3.00" and the ~$900–1,000/month estimate holds at $3.00 (665M × $0.60 + 200M × $3.00 = $999).

## Review — Task 1 (2026-08-05)

**Delivered:** `bakeoff/` package with `schema.py` (SCHEMA_VERSION 1.0.0, 6 enums, 14 frozen dataclasses) and `eventlog.py` (`EventLog`, `ImmutabilityError`). 9 tests, all passing. Implemented verbatim from the plan doc; TDD order held, each module's tests observed failing with `ModuleNotFoundError` before implementation.

**Spec constraints verified:**
- Immutability — `write_run` opens the temp file mode `"x"`; a second write of the same `run_id` raises `ImmutabilityError`. No update or delete method exists on `EventLog`.
- Crash safety — record is fsynced and atomically renamed *before* the index line is appended, so the index never advertises a run that isn't on disk. Covered by `test_partial_write_does_not_corrupt_index`.
- No write-time metrics — schema stores raw observations only.
- `ExclusionClass` has no `MODEL_FAILURE` member, by design.

**Spot check beyond the suite:** wrote a record with a nested `TurnRecord` and `DestructiveEvent`, read it back — round-trip equal, nested enums restored as `Severity`/`DestructiveCategory`, not bare strings.

**Deviation from plan:** venv installed with `pip install -e . --no-deps` plus pytest, rather than `-e '.[dev]'`. Task 1 is stdlib-only; `docker` and `litellm` are first needed in Tasks 5 and 7 and can be installed then. Nothing in the pyproject changed.

**Verify:**

```bash
cd bakeoff && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v
```
